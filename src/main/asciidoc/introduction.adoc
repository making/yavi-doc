== Introduction
YAVI sounds as same as a Japanese slang "YABAI" that means awesome or awful depending on the context.

The concepts are

* No reflection!
* No (runtime) annotation!
* No Java Beans!
* Zero dependency!

If you are not a fan of https://beanvalidation.org/[Bean Validation], YAVI will be an awesome alternative.

For the migration from Bean Validation, refer https://github.com/making/yavi/blob/develop/docs/FromBeanValidationToYAVI.md[the guide].
